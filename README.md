# GOG Creation Club Renamer

This tool renames the Skyrim Anniversary Edition DLC content on GOG to match the exact naming and capitalization found on Steam. This is a requirement of some tools to work properly with the GOG copy of the game.

# How to use

To use this extract the [latest release](https://github.com/EzioTheDeadPoet/GOG_CreationClub_Renamer/releases/latest) into your GOG Skyrim Data folder and run the exe file.

Just make sure to refresh your Windows Explorer Window after running the tool because windows might not update the changed file names visually.
